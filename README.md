## **Introduction**
The importance of information technology (IT) in education, whether it is used to support teaching and learning, or to develop student IT capability, or to support educational management, is now recognized throughout the world.
In our world today information technology is fast influencing how business is done and the ease with which one can do it. Sharing of information and transactions are now carried out across boundaries without any need for contact.

## **Problem/Gap**
Education system is one of the sectors where Information Technology is underutilized. Despite the rise in the use of information technology, it is still a sore point to see how the education sector refuse to take advantage of this emerging trend in information technology. Furthermore, a need to catch up with the rest of the world in information technology means providing or utilizing an educational management tool that leverages on information technology.
A tool that leverages information technology such as a complete school management application is the perfect fit for this purpose. A complete school management application recognizes that some aspects of a school, such as student enrolment, student records, school fees payment, attendance, performance report and a host of other school processes are still being done manually by the schools. Thus, for any school that wants to compete favourably in the future, automating all these processes and more will be highest on their priority list.
